Working on on_the_fly.py

Some todos:

1. Give all words in the dictionary a number based on how many times its been seen/updated
2. Create a list of all phrases including a word, so that when its dictionary bits change, they can all be updated
3. When updating or creating a new word take into acount the dict strength of the words in each phrase

Checking in with:

Adding words works but no continuous updates.

More todos:

4. Every new phrase with no new words can update all the words in its phrase
5. Keep a running list of potential changes
    One per word
    Run it every time the number of occurences doubles, so its getting exponentially slower

1, 2, 4, and 5 done. 3 is not but helped somewhat by 5, Consider doing 3

on_the_fly works.
